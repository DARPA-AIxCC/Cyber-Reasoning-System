# The language property denotes the *primary* language used; vulnerabilities will
# exist solely within code of the CP's primary langauge.

language: "java"

# The cp_address property points the reader to the full challenge project repository
# this exists so that the project.yaml file may be passed around standalone.

cp_address: "git@github.com:DARPA-AIxCC/challenge-002-jenkins-cp.git"

# The cp_sources property denotes the source repository addresses, as well as the
# local path that the repository resides. During competition, the local path directory
# will store a readonly copy of the source code, which will be copied for use.

# The sanitizers property denotes which sanitizers are available for scoring for
# this particular challenge project; when specifying a santizer id to the scoring
# server, use the *key* values here, e.g. use "id_1", not "sanitizer-1: subtype-1".
#
# Note, these key-value mappings are unique for each challenge project, sanitizer
# id "id_1" will likely map to different values for each challenge project.

sanitizers:
  id_1: "OSCommandInjection"

# The harnesses property denotes which aixcc harnesses are available to use for
# triggering sanitizers for this challenge project; when specifying a harness id
# to the scoring server, use the *key* value here, e.g. "test_harness_id_1", not
# the values under 'source' or 'binary'.
#
# The source and binary properties point the reader to the appropriate directory
# paths for the harness source code and executable binary (if exists).
